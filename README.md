Prerequisites

Before we begin, ensure you have the following:

Basic knowledge of Spring Boot and Spring Security.

Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your machine.

A Google Developer account to create OAuth 2.0 credentials.



Step 1: Set Up a Spring Boot Application

If you haven't already, set up a Spring Boot application using Maven. You can use Spring Initializr (https://start.spring.io/) to generate a new project with dependencies with Spring Web and OAuth2 Client.

Step 2: Configure OAuth 2.0 with Google

Create OAuth 2.0 Credentials on Google Developer Console:

Go to the Google Developer Console and create a new project.

Navigate to APIs & Services -> Credentials and click Create Credentials -> OAuth client ID.

Select Web application as the application type.

Add your Spring Boot application's base URL (e.g., http://localhost:8080/login/oauth2/code/google) as an authorized redirect URI.

Configure Application Properties

Open application.properties configure OAuth 2.0 client properties:

spring.security.oauth2.client.registration.google.client-id=YOUR_CLIENT_ID spring.security.oauth2.client.registration.google.client-secret=YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET


Replace YOUR_CLIENT_ID and YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET with the values obtained from Google Developer Console.

Step 3: Create OAuth 2.0 Login Configuration

Configure Security:

Create a security configuration class annotated with @EnableWebSecurity, @Configuration  and configure OAuth 2.0 login:

Code snippet for Configuration.



Breakdown of the Code

1. http.authorizeHttpRequests(auth -> auth.anyRequest().authenticated())

Purpose: This part defines authorization rules for HTTP requests.

Explanation:

http.authorizeHttpRequests() configures authorization for HTTP requests in Spring Security.

.anyRequest().authenticated() specifies that any HTTP request to the application's endpoints must be authenticated. This means users must be logged in to access any endpoint.

2. oauth2Login(Customizer.withDefaults())

Purpose: Configures OAuth 2.0 login functionality.

Explanation:

.oauth2Login() sets up OAuth 2.0 login support in Spring Security, allowing users to authenticate using OAuth 2.0 providers like Google, Facebook, etc.

Customizer.withDefaults() is a convenient method provided by Spring Security that applies default settings for OAuth 2.0 login configuration. It sets up the necessary filters and handlers to initiate OAuth 2.0 authentication flows and handle callbacks.

3. return http.build()

Purpose: Constructs and returns a SecurityFilterChain.

Explanation:

http.build() finalizes the configuration defined in the HttpSecurity object (http) and constructs a SecurityFilterChain.

SecurityFilterChain represents a chain of security filters that intercept requests, enforce security rules, and handle authentication and authorization processes.

Step 4: Implement OAuth 2.0 Login and Authorization Flows

Implement controllers and views to handle OAuth 2.0 login and secure access to your application resources. Here's a simplified example:


Code Snippest for simple get request.

Step 5: Run and Test Your Application

Run Your Application:

Start your Spring Boot application.

Test OAuth 2.0 Login:

Access http://localhost:8080 in your browser.

Click on the "Login with Google" link to initiate the OAuth 2.0 flow.

Authenticate with your Google account. Upon successful authentication, you'll be redirected back to your application.


Conclusion

By setting up a Spring Boot application with OAuth 2.0 dependencies and configuring OAuth 2.0 client for Google, you can enable secure and seamless authentication using Google credentials. This approach simplifies integration with OAuth 2.0 providers and enhances user experience by leveraging existing authentication infrastructure.

OAuth 2.0 in Spring Boot applications facilitates robust and scalable authentication solutions, making it an essential tool for modern web development.
